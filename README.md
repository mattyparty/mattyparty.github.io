# Week 2 Boot Strap Homework

Another Great Read me by Matthew is about to be bestowed upon you! :)

The assignment for this week was to create a responsive porfolio.

I believe that I fufilled most of the requirments.

* The application I deployed is mobile responsive. I did this using mostly boot strap. With the Index page I had to get some instructor help in order for the paragraph to wrap around the image.  We used CSS and media query to aide as well as utilizng the block class.

* I did run the code through W3 schools validation services and found a few errors.  I fixed the major ones but was still struggling with some. With me running out of time I choose to submit and will go back and see what I am missing.

* I used a font awesome icon for my linked in.  It worked out to be pretty easy, also utlized some of their CSS

* I used symantec text tags where applicable

* The Navbar is the same on each page and work pretty well. I like the greyed out/Highlight feature that shows what page its on.

* Feedback i recieved from my previous homework was notes in my css, links and screen shot of the deployed page, I have taken that feeback and implemented to the best of my current ability.

* I commited often 16 in total so far. I tried to do this as often as I could with comments. I assume those comments will get better as I learn more.

I hope you really enjoyed reading this read me! Now...Its time for my final Commit for this assignment
