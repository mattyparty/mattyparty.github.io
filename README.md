# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials

## Requirements

- Updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments
- Github Profile Updated
- Resume Updated
- LinkedIn updated

## Notes about assignment

Luckily I have been keeping up with my profile page and other profiles as the class. I didnt have much to change.

I did however took this opportunity to tweak my page to make it look better. I have a greater understanding of how boostrap works and was able to make their grid system work alot better. I feel my page is clean and friendly to potential clients/employers.

I personally welcome any feedback on this as I am new to the "web dev" world.

Thank you so much!!
