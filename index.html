      <p class="mb-2" > I never know what to time on things like this but I will start where it all began. I have spent most of my professional career working in manufacturing.  Mostly in supply chain or purchasing.  I developed an ability to work with Data and it was noticed by my leaders.
      </p> 
      <p class="mb-2" > 
        I soon transitioned to a reporting role. Spending a lot of time each week making charts and tracking the performance of our org.  This began to become very time consuming and a I looked for ways to quicken the process. This led me to Data Bases.
      </p> 
      <p class="mb-2" >
        Data Bases really opened my eyes to data management and automation. I would define this moment in my career as pivotal.  Staring small with Access and VBA to automate allowed me to product like nothing I had been able to do before.
      </p> 
      <p class="mb-2" >
        Then came <strong>Microsoft SQL.</strong> In comparison to my early days of manipulating spreadsheets gaining this ability was like giving a machine gun to a solider in the revolutionary war.
      </p> 
      <p class="mb-2" >
        Next came <strong>Microsoft Power bi.</strong> Power Bi married with a sql back end structures is in my opinion the endgame for reporting. The Data and the visualizations are now automated and able to share with whomever needs the data.
      </p> 
      <p class="mb-2" >
        My Next logical step in skill development is web and thus why you are reading this BIO for my Web Development boot camp.
        
        I hope to have the same success with Web Dev has I have with data and combine them to the ultimate arsenal of automation and providing tools to end users to drive efficiency and ultimately success.
